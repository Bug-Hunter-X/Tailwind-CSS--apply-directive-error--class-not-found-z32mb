To fix this, ensure that the class name used in the `@apply` directive is defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration or correct any spelling mistakes. Here's the corrected version:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 my-4"></div>
```

This version uses the predefined class `my-4` which adds a margin top and bottom of 1rem.  Alternatively, you can create a custom class:

```css
/* In your main CSS file or Tailwind config */
.my-custom-class {
  @apply bg-blue-500 p-4;
}
```

```html
<div class="@apply my-custom-class"></div>
```

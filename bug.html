This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 @apply my-nonexistent-class"></div>
```

If `my-nonexistent-class` is not defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration, it will cause a compilation error or unexpected behavior.
